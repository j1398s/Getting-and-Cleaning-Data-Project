# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
--can be checked by - str(Data)
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
--can be checked by - head(Data$activity,30)
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
--can be checked by - names(Data)
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
